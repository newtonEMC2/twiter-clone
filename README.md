# Get Started

The app is dockerized. To boot it up: `docker-compose up -d`

You will be able to see the app up and running on your `http://localhost:3000/`

To run the tests: `npm test`

## What can I find here?

As time is limited, and took the following considerations:

1. didn't do too many tests, just some to have a grasp of how i do testing
2. I have used `hexagonal arquitecture`. I put my focus here, as some arquitecture is required in the task description
3. I have used some advanced react patterns like `render props pattern` and `compound component`
4. In regard to UX/UI i just did the bare minimum, to have an interface working
